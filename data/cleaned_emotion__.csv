The Supreme Court is responsible for this tragedy today. All they had to do was their job. All they had to do is tell these states that it is unconstitutional to go around federal voting laws. This could have been done before the election. They saw what was happening. Instead they chose to turn a blind eye to all the fraud that was so obvious. Then they chose to not here any case brought before them. They left millions of Americans with no hope even in our justice system. Instead what is the media and most of our politicians doing now.
